# Bioinformatics---basics-python mini scripts.
This repository contains simple and beginner-friendly Python scripts that I created while learning the fundamentals of bioinformatics and computational biology.
These scripts helped me practice basic concepts used in computational genomics, sequence analysis, and biological data handling.

# Included Scripts

1. dna_gc_calculator.py
Calculates GC content of a DNA sequence
Useful for understanding sequence composition
2. fasta_length_counter.py
Reads a FASTA-style sequence
Returns sequence length without requiring external libraries
3. simple_gene_filter.py
Demonstrates basic filtering of gene lists
Inspired by toxicology-related gene mapping

# Purpose of this Repository

To build foundational skills in Python and computational biology before transitioning into advanced topics such as:
Data preprocessing
PPI networks
Transcriptomics
Computational toxicology
Quantitative biosciences

# Status

Actively learning and improving.
More scripts will be added as I progress.
